	<formula>
		<maths>\mbox f'(ax^n)=anx^{n-1}</maths>
	</formula>
	<explain>The above is the general form for this rule of differentiation.</explain>
	<example>
		<caption>Example 1</caption>
		<maths>f(x)=6x^{4}</maths>
		<annotate>Some function f(x) is given</annotate>
<maths>f'(x)=24x^{3}</maths>
		<annotate>The co-efficient of the x, 6, term is multiplied by the exponent, 4. One is also subtracted from the exponent.</annotate>
<maths>f(x)=2x^{7/2} </maths>
<maths> .: f'(x)= 7x^{5/2}</maths>
		<annotate>Power Rule also applies to terms with fractions. Note that (7/2)-1 = (5/2)</annotate>
<caption>Example 2</caption>

<maths>f(x)=\sqrt2 x^{\sqrt2}</maths>
<maths> .: f'(x)= 2x^{(\sqrt2 -1)}</maths>
		<annotate>Power Rule also works with surds. Note: sqrt(2)*sqrt(2)=2</annotate>

	<conclusion>The power rule is used in differentiating. It is part of all the other rules of differentiation, as it is a fundamental derivative law.</conclusion><category>Differential Calculus</category> </concept>
